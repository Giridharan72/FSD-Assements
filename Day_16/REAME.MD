Countdown Timer with Callback
This JavaScript script provides a countdown timer functionality, and upon reaching zero, it displays a celebratory message.


Functionality:
The countdownFromTen function initiates a countdown from 10 to 1, updating the displayed countdown value every second. After reaching 1, 
it triggers the provided callback function, where you can specify the action to be taken.

Example
For this example, the callback function sets the displayed message to "Happy Independence Day" after the countdown.
